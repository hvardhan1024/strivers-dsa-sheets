## About

Hi, I'm Harshavardhan ðŸ‘‹, a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for web development and data science. This project is a culmination of my interest in programming and my desire to create a resource for learners to grasp data structures and algorithms through interactive animations.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Problem Set**: The application offers a wide range of programming problems, categorized by difficulty and topic.

- **Interactive Animations**: Each problem solution comes with interactive animations to visualize the algorithm in action.

- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, meaning you can contribute to its development, suggest improvements, or customize it to your needs.

- **Language Agnostic**: The problems are presented with pseudocode, making them accessible to learners of all programming backgrounds.

### Demo

You can check out a live demo of Strivers_DSA_Sheets [(will be updated soon)](#).

## Installation

To set up Strivers_DSA_Sheets locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hvardhan1024/strivers-dsa-sheets.git
